# Capstone_Project
Full Stack Web Design
Capstone Project: Software Engineering
Project Overview:
A full-stack web application for a task management system called
TaskMaster. This project will integrate various concepts such as Node.js, Express.js,
databases, APIs, and front-end development.
Project Steps:
1. Project Planning:
○ Objective: Build a task management system that allows users to create, update,
and delete tasks. Users can also organize tasks by priority and set deadlines.
Your system should be scalable, secure, and optimized for performance.
○ Tech Stack:
■ Backend: Node.js, Express.js
■ Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
■ Frontend: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

2. Core Functionalities:
○ User Registration and Authentication:
■ Implement a secure registration and login system using JWT (JSON Web
Tokens) or sessions.
■ Include password hashing using bcrypt.
○ Task Management:
■ Users can create tasks with attributes such as title, description, deadline,
and priority (low, medium, high).
■ Users can update or delete tasks.
○ Task Filtering:
■ Implement a filtering system where users can filter tasks based on priority
or due date.
○ Search Functionality:
■ Implement a search bar to search for tasks based on keywords in the title
or description.
3. Backend Development:
○ Set up a Node.js server with Express to handle API requests for task
management.
○ Use RESTful API principles to build routes for creating, reading, updating, and
deleting tasks.
○ Implement CRUD operations with database integration (MongoDB/PostgreSQL).
4. Database Design:
○ Design a task management schema that stores user information and tasks.
Ensure relationships between users and tasks are well-defined.

○ Use NoSQL (MongoDB) or SQL (PostgreSQL) for storing and retrieving data.
Create collections/tables for users and tasks.

5. Frontend Development:
○ Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to manage their tasks
efficiently.
○ Implement AJAX or Fetch API calls to communicate with the backend, ensuring
asynchronous task management.
○ Use event listeners for buttons and input fields to handle user actions (e.g.,
adding or deleting tasks).

6. Asynchronous Operations & Error Handling:
○ Use promises and async/await for handling asynchronous operations like task
creation and updating.
○ Implement proper error handling on both the client and server sides (e.g.,
validation errors, server errors).
